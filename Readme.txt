This program was created to perform image compression using unsupervised Machine Learning. This application uses Cluster Analysis to find the 16 best colors that will represent the image, thereby reducing the colors in the image to just 16.

The various files are:
1. prg.java: This class does the work of compression.
2. UI.java: This class creates the UI and handles the user interaction.
